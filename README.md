# About

Hi, and welcome to my penetration testing notes page.

This page is a project started with the idea to share and document my knowledge gained in the world of offensive security.

My current knowledge comes from CTFs, real world penetraiton testing, but also from studying for certifications such as the eJPT, eWPT, CPTS and OSCP.
